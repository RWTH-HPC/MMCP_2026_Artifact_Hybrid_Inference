The following rules apply to files in this folder:

If you would like to add a new compiler, you need to make sure that it is added
to `<ZFS_ROOT>/cmake/GetCompiler.cmake` first. Then you need to create a file
named `<COMPILER_NAME>.cmake` and place it in this folder.

In the compiler file, CMake syntax has to be used. The following variables need
to be set in order for the rest of scripts to work properly (careful, variable
names are case-sensitive in Cmake):

BUILD_TYPES
  Needs to be a list of supported build types.

DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE
  Needs to be a string with the default build type. The default build type must
  exist in the BUILD_TYPES list above.

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<BUILD_TYPE>
  Needs to be set for each build type that exists in the BUILD_TYPES variable
  above and contain a list of compiler flags. The build type needs to be all
  uppercase.
