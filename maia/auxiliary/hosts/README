The following rules apply to files in this folder:

If you would like to add a new host, you need to make sure that is added to
`<ZFS_ROOT>/cmake/GetHost.cmake` first. Then you need to create a file named
`<HOST_NAME>.cmake` and place it in this folder.

In the compiler file, CMake syntax has to be used. The following variables need
to be set in order for the rest of scripts to work properly (careful, variable
names are case-sensitive in Cmake):

HOST_SUPPORTED_COMPILERS
  Needs to be a list of supported compilers on this host.

HOST_DEFAULT_COMPILER
  Needs to be set to one of the compilers in HOST_SUPPORTED_COMPILERS. This
  compiler is used if the users chooses none.

HOST_COMPILER_EXE_<compiler>
  Needs to be set with the full path to the compiler executable for each of the
  supported compilers in HOST_SUPPORTED_COMPILERS.

INCLUDE_DIRS
  Needs to be a list of include directories for all required libraries.

LIBRARY_DIRS
  Needs to be a list of library directories for all required libraries.

LIBRARY_NAMES
  Needs to be a list of libraries that need to be linked to ZFS. The name should
  be the library file name without the `lib` prefix or the `.a` or `.so` suffix,
  e.g. `netcdf` or `mpi` instead of `libnetcdf.a` and `libmpi.so`.

INCLUDE_DIRS_<COMPILER>, LIBRARY_DIRS_<COMPILER>, LIBRARY_NAMES_<COMPILER>
  Contents have the same meaning as above, but these values are appended for the
  compiler <COMPILER> (<COMPILER> all-uppercase).

HOST_CONFIGURE
  List of bash commands that should be executed during configure (e.g.
  `module load` commands etc.).

HOST_CONFIGURE_<COMPILER>
  List of additional bash commands that are executed after the commands in
  HOST_CONFIGURE, but only if the selected compiler is <COMPILER> (<COMPILER>
  all-uppercase).
